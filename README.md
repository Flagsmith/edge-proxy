# Edge Proxy

The Flagsmith Edge Proxy allows you to run an instance of the Flagsmith Engine close to your servers. If you are running
Flagsmith within a server-side environment and you want to have very low latency flags, you have two options:

1. Run the Edge Proxy and connect to it from your server-side SDKs
2. Run your server-side SDKs in [Local Evaluation Mode](/clients/overview#2---local-evaluation).

The main benefit to running the Edge Proxy is that you reduce your polling requests against the Flagsmith API itself.

The main benefit to running server side SDKs in [Local Evaluation Mode](/clients/overview#2---local-evaluation) is that
you get the lowest possible latency.
